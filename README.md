# 👤 Nasser Bader Al-Musalhi

🚀 Aspiring Software Engineer | AI Enthusiast | Backend Developer  

As an Artificial Intelligence student at GUtech, I’ve built a strong foundation in software engineering, backend development, and AI/ML applications. I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships at OQ SAOC in IDS & Digital Transformation and at Rihal, where I worked on backend development and API integration. My passion lies in designing intelligent systems that solve real-world challenges, from AI-powered itinerary generators and accident risk mapping to data-driven research projects. With a growing portfolio of full-stack and AI projects, I’m driven to bridge innovation and practical impact.

💡 Passionate about building scalable solutions that merge technology with impactful real-world applications.
